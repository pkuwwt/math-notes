## Notation

  * $$d/dx(\mathbf{y})$$ is a vector whose $$i$$-element is $$d\mathbf{y}_i/dx$$
  * $$d/d\mathbf{x}$$ is a vector whose $$i$$-element is $$dy/d\mathbf{x}_i$$
  * $$d/d\mathbf{x}(\mathbf{y}^T)$$ is a matrix whose $$(i,j)$$-element is $$d\mathbf{y}_j/d\mathbf{x}_i$$
  * $$d/dx(\mathbf{Y})$$ is a matrix whose $$(i,j)$$-element is $$d\mathbf{Y}_{ij}/dx$$
  * $$d/d\mathbf{X}(y)$$ is a matrix whose $$(i,j)$$-element is $$dy/d\mathbf{X}_{ij}$$

Note that the Hermitan transpose is not used because complex conjugates are not analytic.

In the expressions below matrices and vectors $$A,B,C$$ do not depend on $$X$$.

## Derivatives of Linear Products

  * $$d/dx(A\mathbf{Y}B) = A*d/dx(\mathbf{Y}) * B$$
    * $$d/dx(A\mathbf{y}) = A*d/dx(\mathbf{y})$$
