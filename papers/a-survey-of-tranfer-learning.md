# A Survey of Transfer Learning

  * Author: Sinno Jialin Pan, Qiang Yang
  * Year: 2009
  * Keywords: Transfer Learning, Survey, Machine Learning Data Mining
  * Abstract: 
    * Assumption (training and future data in the same feature space) usually not hold
	* Transfer learning can avoid expensive data labeling efforts
	* This survey focuses on **categorizing** and **reviewing** current progress on transfer learning for **classification**, **regression** and **clustering** problem
	* Transfer learning vs. domain adaption/multi-task learning/sample selection bias/co-variate shift

## Introduction

  * Three examples:
    1. Web document classification: different websites
	2. Indoor WiFi localization: different time periods, different devices
	3. Sentiment classification (Product review): lacking enough labels for some products
  * Focus on classification, regression and clustering, not reinforcement learning
